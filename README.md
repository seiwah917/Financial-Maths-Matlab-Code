# Financial Mathematics MATLAB Code

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of concepts and models from financial mathematics.  
The code was developed as part of my coursework and self-study to deepen my understanding of topics in quantitative finance.

## Contents
- **Stochastic Models**: MATLAB scripts for simulating stochastic processes (e.g., Brownian motion, Poisson processes).  
- **Portfolio Theory**: Code for portfolio optimization, efficient frontier, CAPM analysis, and risk-return visualization.  
- **Option Pricing**: Implementations of the Binomial model and Black-Scholes formula for derivative pricing.  
- **Queueing & Simulation**: Scripts for Monte Carlo simulations and queueing models used in financial contexts.  

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open MATLAB.  
3. Run the desired `.m` script from the MATLAB command window, e.g.:  
   ```matlab
   run('PortfolioOptimization.m')
